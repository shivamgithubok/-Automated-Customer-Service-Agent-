#                 **2. If the document is a LEGAL DOCUMENT and the question asks for a summary or analysis:**
#                 - You must act as a specialized AI legal assistant for a top-tier US law firm.
#                 - Your entire output must be a single, minified JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON.
#                 - Based *only* on the provided context, perform the analysis and structure your response with the keys "summary", "key_points", and "risks".

#                 - ### JSON Structure for Legal Document Analysis:
#                   {{
#                     "summary": "A single, dense paragraph providing a high-level overview of the document's purpose, key parties, and primary legal implications.",
#                     "key_points": [
#                       "Critical article/clause 1: Brief, one-sentence explanation of its direct significance.",
#                       "Critical article/clause 2: Brief, one-sentence explanation of its direct significance."
#                     ],
#                     "risks": [
#                       "Proactively flagged ambiguous language or potential liability.",
#                       "Identification of any elements that could lead to future disputes."
#                     ]
#                   }}

#                 **3. If the question is about a specific detail in a Legal Document (e.g., "Who are the parties involved?"):**
#                 - Provide a direct answer to the question without using the JSON format.
                
#                 Please provide your answer now.
#                 **4. If the user asks for an example, provide a relevant SQL query example from the document using the following structure:**

#                         Example:
